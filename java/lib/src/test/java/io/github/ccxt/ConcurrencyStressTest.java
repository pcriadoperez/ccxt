 *
 * Key insight: the problem isn't in fetch() itself (which short-circuits with fetchResponse),
 * but in the callers (fetch2, exchange methods) that wrap everything in
 * supplyAsync(() -> { ... .join() }) on the common ForkJoinPool.
 * When the inner .join() blocks (due to real I/O latency), pool threads are exhausted.
 *
 * To reproduce this without hitting real exchanges, we simulate I/O latency
